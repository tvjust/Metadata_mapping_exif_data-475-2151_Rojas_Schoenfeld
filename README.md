# Metadata_mapping_exif_data-475-2151_Rojas_Schoenfeld
Mostly all pictures, videos, documents taken with a smartphone, or created with a computer will have metadata associated with it.  Some of this metadata allows us to create maps and timelines of where these pictures were taken.  Using ExifTool, we can scrape out GPS coordinates from pictures and documents then using an API we can plot these coordinates in Google Maps or some similar mapping program.  This can help forensic investigators and law enforcement identify the location of interesting places in an investigation or show the origin in which a file was created.
